# World of Artificial Intelligence 🌎

## Welcome to My AI Hub 🕵️‍♀️🌐
Welcome to the exciting world of deep learning! Machine learning and Artificial Intelligence continue to take over the world without slowing down. In order to keep up with our times, we continue our work, which we do with pleasure, from where we left off. Come on this pleasant journey, let's take a slow step together. Just like a newborn baby trying to take the first steps by growing up over time 👶

The ability of machines to make sense of any data means to try to make sense of that data by people. In fact, let's detail the situation I mean with a little example. Object detection is almost everywhere today! Shopping malls, smart devices such as phones and computers, cameras and more .. 🛒🤳 Many technological devices you can think of! Have you ever thought? Facebook can automatically do this for you without tagging the photos you have posted on the Facebook platform for a long time. This is where object recognition or even AI handles the situation. When we analyze this process, which is analyzed by machines, we can make inferences from the specific properties of some data when we analyze it visually.
